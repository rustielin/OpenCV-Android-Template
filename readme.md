# [android-opencv-template](https://github.com/gowithfloat/android-opencv-template) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gowithfloat/android-opencv-template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gowithfloat/android-opencv-template)

An [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) template configured to use [OpenCV for Android](http://opencv.org/platforms/android.html).

While researching OpenCV integration in Android, we found that many of the tutorials in place refer to setting up the Eclipse environment. For those using Android Studio, we thought we'd share an project set up to use the OpenCV library, which was converted to use [Gradle](https://www.gradle.org/) build scripts.

# Usage

Just [download this repository](https://github.com/floatlearning/android-opencv-template/archive/master.zip) and uncompress it. Open Android Studio and choose `Open an existing Android Studio project`. Navigate to the folder containing this template and the project should open without issue and be ready to build. Requires Android 2.2 SDK (API 8) aka Froyo.
